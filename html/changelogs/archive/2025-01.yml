      Borrowing techniques from an ancient Martian martial artist, as well as an entire
      franchise of extremely muscular acrobats and performance artists, talented assistants
      have discovered that a swift application of a flimsy chair to the back of the
      head can end fights more promptly than just bashing the opponent's head in with
      their foot. That, and it looks awesome.
  - balance: Chairs start to break apart when you hit someone with them or block an
      attack with them.
