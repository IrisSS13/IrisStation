  Skies-Of-Blue:
  - balance: You will no longer experience a heart attack at high fear levels (though
      you can certainly asphyxiate through a panic attack).
  - balance: Monophobia progresses much slower than before. It now takes five minutes
      of isolation for stage one of fear, ten for stage two, and close to seventeen
      minutes for a full blown panic attack.
  - bugfix: the job and background options in character creator should be less broken
2025-06-02:
