These vessels are designed for incredible endurance in the field while keeping themeslves nice and safe throughout!<br><br>This guide will cover the basics of maintaining crucial systems of such a vessel. You are encouraged to delegate these tasks to your crew, who should have recieved basic training in operating such systems.<br><br>---<center><b>Electrical Systems</b></center>The electrical systems of the Bristol-class are designed for redundancy and endurance. While Johnson & Company encourages modifying your setup to meet specifications, we can only include the guide for a standard setup.<br><br><b>STIRLING CHECKLIST:</b><br>1. Verify gas tank integrity - there should be no leaks anywhere in the engine room. If there is a leak, seal it and alert your engineer.<br>2. Start thermomachine. Set it to the minimum temperature.<br>3. Wrench down the canister of carbon dioxide onto the connector next to the Stirling Generator chamber. This will ensure that heat can be transferred from the burn chamber to the Stirlings.<br>3. Engage all pumps out of the oxygen and plasma tanks. Set the mixer facing towards the Stirling to <b>30% Plasma, 70% Oxygen</b> and maximise pressure.<br>4. Using the air alarm, engage the scrubber in the chamber. Set it to extended range and scrub everything bar oxygen, plasma, and tritium.<br>5. Turn on the filter - you may set it to recover certain gases such as water vapour, though do attempt to account for extreme temperature - and turn on the waste to space valve. Engage the igniter at the Stirling control station.<br>6. Calibrate SMES.<br><br><br>In event of a cold start: Activate the surplus B.A.P.G.M and SUPERPACMAN generators provided to your ship. This will provide the minimum amount of power necessary to cold-start the Stirling generators. If both of these are missing, please seek alternate sources of power. RTG boards are kept in your Vault in case whoever nicked the generators left the fuel alone.<br><br><b>EMERGENCY POWER:</b><br>In event of total loss of ship power, an emergency generator is located in the forward maintenance room immediately next to the lavatory. It is also equipped with an SMES to regulate and store output.<br><br> Spare fuel is kept with the emergency supplies lociker immediately next to the generator, and should be replaced after use. Note that the emergency generator cannot run the ship for a long period of time.<br><br><center><b>Life Support</b></center><br>The Bristol-class is fitted with a long-endurance life support array produced in-house at the London Fleetyards. While the setup starts pre-programmed on arrival, loss of power may result in an automated reset.<br><br><b>LIFE SUPPORT RESTART CHECKLIST:</b><br>1. Ensure that the mixer facing towards the electrical room is set to <b>22% Oxygen and 78% Nitrogen</b> at maximum pressure. Node 1 is responsible for oxygen flow and node 2 is for nitrogen.<br>2. Maximise the outlet pumps on both nitrogen and oxygen tanks.<br>3. If contaminants have entered the main air loop, a volume pump next to the Stirling control station may be used to send the air mix to waste.<br>4. Program filters to send gas to their respective tank. Tank 1 handles oxygen, tank 2 handles nitrogen, tank 3 handles plasma.<br><br>In the event that the main life support system is incapacitated, a spare air canister can be hooked up to the distribution loop in the emergency generator room.<br><br><br><table width='65%' bgcolor='#f19518' border=1 cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' align='center'><th></font><font color='white'><font size=5 face='MS Gothic'><center>Johnson <font size=3>&</font> Co</center></font></th></table><center><i>Building a Better Future</i></center>"
